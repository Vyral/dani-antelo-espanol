        <title>What Are the 5 Factors That Influence a Home’s Asking Price?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/A-XjqyE53-U?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pricing a home is part science, part art, and understanding the reasoning behind this pricing will make you a smarter buyer and help you understand exactly what you’re getting for your money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before sticking a “For Sale” sign in front of a home, here are the five factors Realtors look at when pricing it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What’s happening in your local market.&lt;/strong&gt; Real estate conditions can change quickly, so understanding what’s going on now is very important. For example, how fast are properties being snapped up? Is it a buyer’s or seller’s market? Low inventory means it’s a seller’s market and there’s more room to push prices up, while high inventory means it’s a buyer’s market. Our market, in particular, can change quickly, so you need to keep yourself updated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The specific location of the home.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not just talking about its ZIP code—I’m talking about whether there are good schools nearby, it sits in a cul-de-sac or backs up to a busy street, etc. It’s worth noting that in most areas, homes that have easier access to a highway fetch a higher sale price.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. A comparative market analysis.&lt;/strong&gt; Oftentimes, sellers will already have a number in mind when I meet them for a listing presentation, and this number isn’t necessarily the most accurate. Homeowners tend to develop an emotional attachment to their homes over time and think it’s worth more than it is. A Realtor will be able to look at comparable properties on the MLS that have sold in the past six months to give the home a comparative market analysis. The MLS provides a lot of good information for this purpose, too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. The home’s amenities (and overall appeal).&lt;/strong&gt; Today’s buyers look at more than just a home’s square footage. Most of the time, they prefer brand-name appliances, larger bedrooms and closets, lots of light, central air conditioning, outdoor space, easy parking, and, in general, new construction over older homes. Layout and functionality are also huge pluses in terms of desirability, which means older homes that aren’t upgraded will be priced lower. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Whether or not it’s a fixer-upper.&lt;/strong&gt; You won’t get a lower price just because you’re thinking of buying a fixer-upper—location plays a big role in pricing these types of homes too. On the other hand, if you’re buying a newer turnkey property, expect to pay more for it because quality trumps quantity every time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Real estate conditions can change quickly, so understanding what’s going on now is very important.%20http://localhost:4000/what-are-the-5-factors-that-influence-a-homes-asking-price.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Real estate conditions can change quickly, so understanding what’s going on now is very important.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any more questions about how homes are priced or you’re a seller and you want to know what your home is worth, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to speak with you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Crucial Parts of a Homebuyer’s Offer</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cc1C97zvuAE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often when I’m out with buyers who have found a home they want to buy, they turn to me and ask, “What do we do now?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I do when this happens is study the comps to make sure that our offer is backed up by actual numbers and that the price presented to us by the listing agent is, in fact, in line with the home’s actual market value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we come up with a price, &lt;strong&gt;we’ll then proceed to make an offer.&lt;/strong&gt; On page 167 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-Buy-House-Houston-Successfully/dp/1792789300&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my book,&lt;/a&gt; “How to Buy a House in Houston, TX,” I include examples of the offer documents that we use. Written up by the Texas Real Estate Commission, these contracts are standardized, promulgated forms that we download and fill in as we solidify our offer. Remember that it is incredibly important to fill out these forms correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s an overview of what you’ll find on these documents:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the form, there’s a section where you’ll fill in the names of each party (the buyers and the sellers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following that, there’s a space for you to fill in &lt;strong&gt;how much you’re offering to the seller&lt;/strong&gt; in terms of the sales price, as well as how much of a down payment you’re putting down. You might think that you’ll need to put down 20%, but sometimes you’ll find that you only need to put down 5% or 10%; as long as your lender is OK with it, that number can change at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, &lt;strong&gt;you’ll state how much you’ll put in for an earnest money deposit&lt;/strong&gt;. For those unfamiliar, an earnest money deposit is basically a promise to the seller that you, as the buyer, are serious about making the purchase. The amount is normally 1% of the asking price. Once the contract is signed by both parties, the buyer must deliver this deposit to the title company, which can be selected by the buyer or the seller. For homes that aren’t new construction, the seller typically pays for the title policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next important part of an offer to pay close attention to is the &lt;strong&gt;closing date&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the date on which the sale will actually happen. Typically a contract can be closed between 30 and 45 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, there are sections in which the following information can be filled in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any &lt;strong&gt;special provisions&lt;/strong&gt; you may want to address with respect to the house&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any &lt;strong&gt;settlements and expenses&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, are you asking for closing cost contributions?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any &lt;strong&gt;addendums&lt;/strong&gt; that we plan to include in the contract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, on page 8 of this form, you’ll find the “termination option” section. Many people have asked me what it means for a home to be ‘option pending’—this just means that the property has an accepted offer on the table. Once we have an accepted offer on the table and the contract has been both signed and executed, that’s when the option period begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you develop cold feet about the property or find a different property that you like more, the option period is the time to terminate the contract%20http://localhost:4000/the-crucial-parts-of-a-homebuyers-offer.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you develop cold feet about the property or find a different property that you like more, the option period is the time to terminate the contract”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the option period, you have 10 days to do your due diligence.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the time to schedule an inspector to come view the property, talk to your neighbors about the neighborhood, or to talk to the City of Houston if you have particular questions about the home. You’ll also want to take this time to get quotes for home insurance to ensure that there are policies available that fit in your budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further still, if you develop cold feet about the property or find a different property that you like more, the option period is the time to terminate the contract. &lt;strong&gt;If you terminate the contract during this period, you will get your earnest money deposit back, but you won’t get the $100 to $500 option fee back.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this information has been helpful to you! If you have any questions about placing an offer on a property, feel free to contact me. I’d be happy to walk you through the contract. If you’d like even more detailed information about purchasing a home, I encourage you to look into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-Buy-House-Houston-Successfully/dp/1792789300&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt;, “How to Buy a House in Houston, TX.”&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Can You Improve Houston By Plogging?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VYfR0gYW87E?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking a lot lately about why people decide to live in the neighborhoods that they do. &lt;strong&gt;The bottom line, I think, is that people make communities great.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s all about who lives there, what they do, and the little things that contribute to great communities. Recently, I was talking to my friend Sara, and she told me about a new exercise she’s been doing called “plogging.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essentially, it’s the practice of picking up trash while jogging or walking&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s very easy, very simple, and all you need is a pair of gloves and a plastic bag. The plogging movement started in Sweden a few years ago, and we’re doing our part to bring it to Houston. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The cleaner our drains are, the less likely it is that our streets will flood in the future.%20http://localhost:4000/how-can-you-improve-houston-by-plogging.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The cleaner our drains are, the less likely it is that our streets will flood in the future.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the next two weeks, I’d love for you all to accept the plogging challenge.&lt;/strong&gt; Next time you go for a walk or a run, adopt a drain in your neighborhood and get to plogging. After you’re done, take a picture of yourself holding the trash bag. Then, tag me on Instagram @YourHoustonBroker and make sure to include the hashtag #ploggingchallengehouston. &lt;strong&gt;At the end of the two weeks, you’ll be entered into a drawing to win four movie tickets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on &lt;strong&gt;August 3rd, you can join me for a fun community event&lt;/strong&gt; with refreshments, raffle prizes. fresh air and good vibes! The event starts at 10 A.M. at the Stevens Elementary park (1910 Lamonte Ln., Houston, TX 77018). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a fun thing I wanted to do to help clean up our community a bit and demonstrate how we can help keep our drains clean. We’ve lived through some traumatic flooding here, so the cleaner our drains are, the less likely it is that our streets are going to flood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Avoid Paying Capital Gains Tax When Selling</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHMPrbKTTwc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got some advice to share with you today about how you can avoid paying capital gains taxes on the sale of your home. Buying a home will be one of the largest investments of your life, so it’s good to know that there are some advantages to selling that property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, what are capital gains? Items like cars, stocks, and bonds are all called capital assets. So is a home. &lt;strong&gt;When you sell an asset for more than you paid for it, the profit is called a capital gain.&lt;/strong&gt; When you sell a car for more than what you paid, you have to report that to the IRS, who will tax you on that amount. However, homes are excluded from this capital gains tax, provided that you qualify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, full disclaimer: I am not a CPA, I am just your Realtor. Double check all of this information with your CPA before doing anything.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you’re single, the exemption goes up to $250,000.%20http://localhost:4000/how-to-avoid-paying-capital-gains-tax-when-selling.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you’re single, the exemption goes up to $250,000.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you need to do to qualify for a capital gains tax exemption? &lt;strong&gt;First, you have to have owned the house for at least two years.&lt;/strong&gt; You can also qualify for the exemption if you have lived in the home as your primary residence for at least two of the last five years. They don’t even have to be consecutive years. Finally, you can only use this exemption once every two years. If you’re planning on using this exemption in the future, I advise you to keep a record of how much you paid for the home and how much you’ve spent on improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much can you exempt? &lt;strong&gt;The amount depends on how you file.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re single, the exemption goes up to $250,000. For married couples, that amount doubles to $500,000. To find out how much your capital gains are, subtract your purchase price by your sale price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s been a recent change in the rules which allows exemptions on special circumstances, such as a spouse’s death. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a book recently recalled“How to Buy a House in Houston, TX” that I’d be happy to get you a free copy of. If you want one or if you have any other real estate-related questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Latest Numbers From the Houston Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/86bZrpTQnXo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we head deeper into spring here in Houston, buyers will love all the inventory that’s available. This is the time of year when sellers are putting their properties on the market, so you’ll have many choices to pick from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, homebuyers may hate all the competition this inventory is sure to generate, especially those in the price point between $250,000 and $350,000—properties in this range are being snatched up quicker than anything else. &lt;strong&gt;That means if you see something you like, you’d better put an offer on it now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather doesn’t look as though it’s going to get any cooler, so remember when you’re out shopping for homes to wear comfortable shoes, drink plenty of water, and wear sunscreen. The Houston heat can really sneak up on you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re on the market this season or planning to enter it later in the year, you need to make sure that you’re ready to make a move when the time comes. It’s a complete myth that you need to put down 20% when purchasing a property; you can put as little as 5% down on a conventional loan or just 3.5% if you qualify for an FHA loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I wrote a book called “How to Buy a House In Houston, Texas,” and I’d be happy to send you a copy if you’re interested in getting prepared for any market in any season. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting at 1:38 in the video above, you’ll see a few charts that will tell you how each category has changed in terms of percentages from last year to this year.&lt;/strong&gt; Single-family homes reached a 3.9-month supply in March 2019, which is up from a 3.3-month supply in March 2018—this marks the greatest supply of homes we’ve had since October 2018. For perspective, housing inventory across the U.S. is currently at a 3.5-month supply, according to the latest report from the National Association of Realtors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Earlier this year, I wrote a book called “How to Buy a House In Houston, Texas,” and I’d be happy to send you a copy if you’re interested in getting prepared for any market in any season.%20http://localhost:4000/the-latest-numbers-from-the-houston-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Earlier this year, I wrote a book called “How to Buy a House In Houston, Texas,” and I’d be happy to send you a copy if you’re interested in getting prepared for any market in any season.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home prices reached their highest levels ever this March. The median price increased 2.1% to $240,000. The average price rose 2% to $298,766.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 64 days, the days on market, or the number of days it took the average home to sell, was completely unchanged from last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Townhomes and condos still remain a challenging segment of the Houston housing market. March brought us our seventh straight month of declining sales, dropping down 9.2% to 555 units sold, as compared to the 607 units sold just a year earlier. The average price was statistically flat at $211,241, while the median price rose 2.8% to $174,750. Inventory grew from a 3.6-month supply to a 4.4-month supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, if you’d like more information about what’s going on in our market, feel free to reach out to me at any time. I’d love to speak with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rlY0iJMl5JU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my latest community spotlight video, I’m featuring Stevens Elementary School. I live close enough to this school that I can hear the principal’s voice over the loudspeaker from outside my house, so it only made sense for me to come take a visit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining me for this spotlight is Tim Weltin, a wraparound resource specialist who works with the school. In case you don’t know, a wraparound resource specialist is someone who helps with non-academic support within a school. Essentially, Tim assesses what the school needs and then matches those needs with community resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps of our conversation so that you can skip ahead to the section(s) that interest you the most: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0:33—A little background on Tim’s career and his involvement with the school &lt;br /&gt;2:27—An overview of the programs available at the school and how people can get involved&lt;br /&gt;3:42—Getting to know the culture of Stevens Elementary &lt;br /&gt;6:48—Why academic rating systems don’t tell the whole story of a school’s worth&lt;br /&gt;10:56—How the school’s SPARK park has benefited the community&lt;br /&gt;11:40—Where Tim sees Stevens Elementary headed in the next five years &lt;br /&gt;13:35—A final message from Tim&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to know more about how you can give back to our Oak Forest community, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a commitment to my local school, I will be donating a portion of all my sales in the 77018 zip code to the Stevens Elementary art department. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Do Realtors Get Paid?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBbumQC32iE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this blog is to provide answers to all your real estate questions. Recently, I was asked something very interesting: How do Realtors get paid?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, if you’ve been thinking of buying but have been worrying about the cost of hiring an agent, I’ve got amazing news: Working with a Realtor won’t cost you a cent. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can this be? Simply put, Realtors in Houston are paid a 6% commission rate (on average) at closing on a home’s final price, and this amount is paid by the seller. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you previously assumed that hiring a Realtor to help you buy a home would only amount to more money out of your pocket, think again. Hiring an agent to help you find the perfect home will not only ensure a smoother experience overall, but it may also actually save you money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Realtors have the skills, experience, and resources necessary to point you in the right direction during your home search.%20http://localhost:4000/how-do-realtors-get-paid.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Realtors have the skills, experience, and resources necessary to point you in the right direction during your home search.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing you need to do is to sign a buyer representation agreement, which essentially states that you won’t be working with another Realtor for the next three to six months. Of course, many agents will be happy to let you out of this contract if you’re not satisfied with their service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realtors have the skills, experience, and resources necessary to point you in the right direction during your home search. I recently wrote about this in my new book “How to Buy a House in Houston, Texas.” &lt;strong&gt;You can get a copy for yourself right &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-Buy-House-Houston-Successfully/dp/1792789300/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=daniela+antelo+book&amp;amp;qid=1553281268&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spell&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or you can contact me directly so that we can speak about the real estate process in greater depth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2 Ways You Can Save Money as a Homeowner in 2019</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/h118HMNb88g?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to save money as a homeowner in 2019, there are a couple of ways you can do so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, if you currently live in your primary residence—not an investment property—&lt;strong&gt;you can file for homestead exemption.&lt;/strong&gt; The deadline to file is coming up fast, though, and keep in mind that you must have lived in your current home as of January 1 of this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To file for this exemption, you can either go &lt;a href=&quot;http://hcad.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; or download the application and submit it via mail. In the latter case, you’ll need a copy of your driver’s license with your primary residence listed. The filing process is completely free, so don’t fall for any spam mail that offers to file for you for a nominal fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You might be surprised at how much of a reduction you get, and who doesn’t want that extra cash in their pocket?%20http://localhost:4000/2-ways-you-can-save-money-as-a-homeowner-in-2019.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You might be surprised at how much of a reduction you get, and who doesn’t want that extra cash in their pocket?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second way you can save money is by &lt;strong&gt;protesting your property taxes.&lt;/strong&gt; Property taxes tend to increase every year, but you can protest yours by bringing a copy of your property tax disclosure to the courthouse in person. Texas is a non-disclosure state, so remember that you’re not required to reveal how much you paid for your property. As with filing for homestead exemption, this process is free. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like help protesting your property taxes, I would be happy to do a comparative market analysis of your local area to supplement your position. In any case, don’t be afraid to give it a shot. You might be surprised at how much of a reduction you get, and who doesn’t want that extra cash in their pocket?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any more questions about this topic or you have any other real estate needs I can take care of, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;
