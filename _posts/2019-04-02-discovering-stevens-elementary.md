For my latest community spotlight video, I’m featuring Stevens Elementary School. I live close enough to this school that I can hear the principal’s voice over the loudspeaker from outside my house, so it only made sense for me to come take a visit.&nbsp;

Joining me for this spotlight is Tim Weltin, a wraparound resource specialist who works with the school. In case you don’t know, a wraparound resource specialist is someone who helps with non-academic support within a school. Essentially, Tim assesses what the school needs and then matches those needs with community resources.

**For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps of our conversation so that you can skip ahead to the section(s) that interest you the most:&nbsp;**

*I work with clients whose main decision driver is the school they are zoned to. When it comes to real estate, properties that are zoned to higher ranked schools tend to sell for more. However, basing your real estate choices solely on a school ranking has consequences. For starters, your property could be rezoned without notice in the future. Second, if the school is at full capacity, you might not be able to send your kids there.&nbsp;*

*Before looking at rankings, which is ultimately just a number, take your actions a step further. Go inside your local school and talk to the people they are making a difference there. What programs are they offering? Who is the principal? What does the school cafeteria look like? These are things you won’t get from a ranking.&nbsp;*

***As a commitment to my local school, I will be donating a portion of all my sales in the 77018 zip code to the Stevens Elementary art department.&nbsp;***
