Many have wondered, “How is our Houston market looking?” The truth is, it was a slow December—one of the slowest since I got my start in real estate.

That all changed when we entered 2019. My phone has been ringing off the hook!

What I’m seeing from our market right now is that it’s in the hands of buyers. Inventory is high and interest rates remain fairly low. With all the talk of interest rates going up, though, **buyers should heed this information and not delay in taking action while rates stay where they are.**

Now that the holiday craze is behind us, **sellers should begin to turn their attention and get serious about putting their homes on the market.**

**The bottom line is, in terms of real estate, Houston is a very healthy place to be.**<br>If you have any real estate-related questions for me or for help with any and all of your real estate needs, please reach out to me by phone at 713-494-8170 or by email at [AnteloDani@KW.com.](What I’m seeing from our market right now is that it’s in the hands of buyers.
