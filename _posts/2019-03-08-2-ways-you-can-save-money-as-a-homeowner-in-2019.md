If you’re looking to save money as a homeowner in 2019, there are a couple of ways you can do so.&nbsp;

First, if you currently live in your primary residence—not an investment property—**you can file for homestead exemption.** The deadline to file is coming up fast, though, and keep in mind that you must have lived in your current home as of January 1 of this year.&nbsp;

To file for this exemption, you can either go [online](http://hcad.org/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;or download the application and submit it via mail. In the latter case, you’ll need a copy of your driver’s license with your primary residence listed. The filing process is completely free, so don’t fall for any spam mail that offers to file for you for a nominal fee.

The second way you can save money is by **protesting your property taxes.** Property taxes tend to increase every year, but you can protest yours by bringing a copy of your property tax disclosure to the courthouse in person. Texas is a non-disclosure state, so remember that you’re not required to reveal how much you paid for your property. As with filing for homestead exemption, this process is free.&nbsp;

If you’d like help protesting your property taxes, I would be happy to do a comparative market analysis of your local area to supplement your position. In any case, don’t be afraid to give it a shot. You might be surprised at how much of a reduction you get, and who doesn’t want that extra cash in their pocket?

If you have any more questions about this topic or you have any other real estate needs I can take care of, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
