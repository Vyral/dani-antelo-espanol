People often tell me they can’t buy a home for a variety of reasons. They can’t afford it, it’s not the right time, and so on. My response is always this: **How do you know?**

If you haven’t done your homework, you really have no idea whether you can buy or not. You may be surprised to find you’re more ready than you think. **In fact, I’ve written a book on how to find out.**

<br>My book, “How to Buy a House in Houston, TX,” will give you everything you need to know about getting ready to start the home search. **The very first step in the process is setting up a meeting with a lender.** They’ll look at your finances, credit, and more to determine what you can afford.

There are always great opportunities in Houston real estate, especially now that we’re undergoing a shift toward a buyer’s market.

<br>If you’re ready to begin your search, have any questions, or would like to learn more, give me a call at **713-494-8170** or email **antelodani@gmail.com.** I look forward to hearing from you soon.
