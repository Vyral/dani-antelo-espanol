The goal of this blog is to provide answers to all your real estate questions. Recently, I was asked something very interesting: How do Realtors get paid?

**Well, if you’ve been thinking of buying but have been worrying about the cost of hiring an agent, I’ve got amazing news: Working with a Realtor won’t cost you a cent. **

How can this be? Simply put, Realtors in Houston are paid a 6% commission rate (on average) at closing on a home’s final price, and this amount is paid by the seller. 

So if you previously assumed that hiring a Realtor to help you buy a home would only amount to more money out of your pocket, think again. Hiring an agent to help you find the perfect home will not only ensure a smoother experience overall, but it may also actually save you money.

The only thing you need to do is to sign a buyer representation agreement, which essentially states that you won’t be working with another Realtor for the next three to six months. Of course, many agents will be happy to let you out of this contract if you’re not satisfied with their service. 

Realtors have the skills, experience, and resources necessary to point you in the right direction during your home search. I recently wrote about this in my new book “How to Buy a House in Houston, Texas.” **You can get a copy for yourself right [here](https://www.amazon.com/How-Buy-House-Houston-Successfully/dp/1792789300/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=daniela+antelo+book&amp;qid=1553281268&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1-spell){: target="_blank"}, or you can contact me directly so that we can speak about the real estate process in greater depth.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
