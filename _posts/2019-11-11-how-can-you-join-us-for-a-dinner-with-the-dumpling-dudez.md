It’s November—and that means it’s also Gratitude Month. With so much of our business being referral-based, we want to give back to all of you for your continued support. We’re doing it by hosting a dinner party with the Dumpling Dudez. For the entire month of November, if you send us a referral of someone looking to buy, sell, or lease a property in Houston, you’ll be entered into a drawing. 10 lucky winners will be picked on November 30 to come to this dinner in January. If you have any other questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
